# Data-Science-Python

This respository is dealing with the basic programs done while practicing data science algorithms in Python. The scripts can give you an idea about the basic workflow in the easiest way for doing machine learning in Python. There's a lot more to learn, but gotta start somewhere.

I will upload the datasets soon so that it would be a good reference for self study for students and enthusiasts.
